Created new readme file to check if it wokrs and Darina cloned repo,make a dependency to maintain repo(project) and, finally, created a new branch. If it's true, this file will be removed by someone, who will notice this README file. In that case, if it won't be Darina, please, tell her that it's all right. Thanks for attention!
